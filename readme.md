# Weather Information Display Web App
This is a basic web application that fetches weather data for a specific location and displays it to the user. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information for a given location and then displays it in a user-friendly format on a web page.
# Features

2. Displays weather information including temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and weather description.
3. Uses a simple and responsive card-based layout to present the information.
# Installation
1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
# Code Structure
The main code is written in JavaScript and uses the fetch API to make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather data.

The retrieved data is processed and displayed on the web page using the displayWeather function.

The web page layout and styling are defined in the index.html file and use Tailwind CSS for styling.

The application is responsive and should work on various screen sizes.

# Customization
You can customize the location for which you want to fetch weather data by modifying the API request URL in the weather function.

You can also customize the layout and styling of the weather card by modifying the HTML and Tailwind CSS in the index.html file.
